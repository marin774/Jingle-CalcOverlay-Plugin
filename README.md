Once you've installed the plugin and restarted Jingle, enable the plugin and configure it:
1. Open the "Plugins" tab in Jingle.
2. Click on "Open Config" next to Calc Overlay.
3. Enable overlay by clicking on the "Enable overlay" checkbox.

## Settings
**To make configuring easier, I highly recommend you add the overlay image to OBS first.** Click "Copy Image Path" and paste it in an Image Source in OBS.

After you edit a setting, a dummy measurement will be shown on the overlay so you can see your settings. After you are done, disable and enable the overlay.

### General settings
- **Overlay position** - positions the overlay within the image (image is always the same size, so this setting will anchor it to a corner)
- **Overworld coords** - same as the Ninjabrain Bot setting
- **Show angle direction** - whether to show what direction you need to go next to Angle
- **Show coords based on dimension** - displays ONLY overworld or nether coords, depending on the last dimension you F3+C'd in

### Column settings
- **Show column** - whether to show the column or not
- **Show icon** - if the column is visible, whether to show the icon above the column or not
- **Move up** - moves the column 1 up
- **Move down** - moves the column 1 down
